# Solar-system-simulator
I'm interested for example how the total solar radiation from the sun varies by latitude over the course of the year (Heat distribution over a year.py). I test this with various tilt angles. This is a project I'm working on mostly for fun. Later I was able to use this as a project for a computational physics project in the course Computational Physics. I'm an avid astronomy enthusiast and want to learn more things about astronomy. 

The file localSun.py is the main file and the rest use it.
