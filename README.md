# Solar-system-simulator
I'm creating a simulation of the solar system. Thus far I have Earth orbiting the sun in a circular orbit. I'm interested for example how the total solar radiation from the sun varies by latitude over the course of the year. I test this with various tilt angles. This is project I'm working on for fun. I'm an avid astronomy enthusiast and want to learn more things about the astronomy.

Next step is putting the Earth on an elliptical orbit and seeing how the varying distance also affects the received solar radiation.
