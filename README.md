# Solar-system-simulator
I'm creating a simulation of the solar system. Thus far I have Earth orbiting the sun in a circular orbit. I'm interested for example how the total solar radiation from the sun varies by latitude over the course of the year (Heat distribution over a year.py). I test this with various tilt angles. This is project I'm working on for fun. I'm an avid astronomy enthusiast and want to learn more things about astronomy.

Next step is putting the Earth on an elliptical orbit and seeing how the varying distance also affects the received solar radiation. I'm working on this project every day as a hobby.

The file localSun.py is the main file and the rest use it.

The test files are used for testing how well certain setups agree. For example Test - Vpython Elliptical.py is used to test an elliptical orbit and an animation of the result is shown. Next step is integrating this into the localSun file.
