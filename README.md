# Solar-system-simulator
I'm creating a simulation of the solar system. Thus far I have Earth orbiting the sun in a circular orbit. I'm interested for example how the total solar radiation from the sun varies by latitude over the course of the year. I test this with various tilt angles. Next step is putting the Earth on an elliptical orbit and seeing how the varying distance also affects the received solar radiation.
